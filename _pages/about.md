Hi!
======
I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago working on quantum programming languages and verification, adivsed by [Robert Rand](https://rand.cs.uchicago.edu/) and [John Reppy](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/). My interests lie in programming languages: compilation, verification, and using PL for better software engineering. I'm currently exploring applying these techniques to quantum computing.  Before starting my PhD, I obtained my undergraduate degree in computer science from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Subsequently, I worked as a software engineer at LogMeIn. Being an engineer at heart, I still possess a strong passion for utilizing technology to tackle complex challenges and for creating high-quality software.

Education
======
* B.Sc. in Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, 2019
* MS in Computer Science, The University of Chicago, USA, 2023
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, The University of Chicago, USA, 2025 (expected)

Languages
======
* German, English (bilingual)

Currently working on
======

* Formalizing ZX Calculus to create a verified ZX calculus optimizer
  * Co-Leading with Ben Caldwell under guidance of Robert Rand & John Reppy
  * [This work won a grant from the Air Force Office of Scientifc Research (AFOSR)](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/assistant-professor-robert-rand-receives-air-force-young-investigator-grant/)
* Proof automation using E-Graph systems
  * What if proof search was smart and avoided re-computation? Can we use it to solve interesting domain-specific applications?

Work experience
======

* Jun 2022 - Sep 2022: Research Intern
  * Microsoft Quantum, Remote, US
  * Created quantum algorithm samples (Entanglement Swapping, Solving Sudoku with Grover's Search, and Numerical Integration using Quantum Amplitude Estimation) using Q#, Qiskit, and the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for the Azure Quantum platform.

* Dec 2019 - Aug 2020: Assosicate Software Engineer
  * LogMeIn, Karlsruhe, Germany
  * Built a system to mass deploy files, scripts to virtual machines in a private cloud. For this I worked in a cross functional Software Engineering and DevOps team with members on multiple continents managing a global private cloud with thousands of active virtual machines. Built out the high availibility deployment on a container infrastructure.  Built a terraform provider for private cloud. Was repeatedly recognized for outstanding work by my superior. Conducted multiple technical interviews
  * Technologies used: Java, Spring, (Postgres)SQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Go, Terraform, Ansible

* Sep 2018 - Nov 2019: Software Engineering Intern (part-time)
  * LogMeIn, Karlsruhe, Germany
  * Working on internal tools for developing products used by millions everyday. Won Team Quality Award. Built end-to-end testing framework. Built Terraform provider prototype for private cloud
  * Technologies used: Java, Spring, Docker, Go, Terraform, Selenium

Misc. Projects
======

* I created a bunch of study guides during undergrad. So if you are a KIT computer science student please find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/adrianleh?tab=repositories&q=revision&type=public&language=&sort=). (Note: Some of them are in German language)

* I [benchmarked](https://github.com/adrianleh/quantum-compiler-benchmark) a bunch of quantum compilers to see if juxtaposition with other compilers would improve performance

* [Here](https://github.com/adrianleh/ntfs-paper) is an overview of NTFS I wrote for a seminar

* There's more on my [GitHub](https://github.com/adrianleh)

Service and leadership
======
* Jan 2023 POPL Student volunteer
  * POPL Conference, Boston, MA, USA

* May 2017 - Jun 2018 Hack & Söhne Hackathon Organization, Sponsorship Management
  * Hack & Söhne, Karlsruhe, Germany
  * Organizing events such as the [OpenCodes Hackathon](https://opencodes.io) and the [Hacktival](https://hacktival.io), which themselves were Germany's biggest student run hackathons in 2018 and 2019. I was invloved in all aspects of organizing these events, from hands-on work at the event, to financial planning. My main focus though lay on sponsorship acquisition and management to make sure the event's funding is secured.

* Jun 2019 - Jun 2019 Joint Chairman Hack & Söhne, talKIT - The technology symposium 
  * Hack & Söhne, Karlsruhe, Germany
  * talKIT - The technology symposium  is a student organisation that annually organizes the largest European student technology symposium and is the parent organization of Hack & Söhne. In my role I got to represent Hack & Söhne both internally and externally. During my time two sucessful events were run and the stability of the organization was ensured. 

* May 2016 - Nov 2017 Webmaster at sports club
  * TFC Ludwigshafen, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany
