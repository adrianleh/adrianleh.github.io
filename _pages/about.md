Hi!
======
I'm a PhD student at the University of Chicago working on quantum programming languages and verification, adivsed by [John Reppy](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/), working with [Robert Rand](https://rand.cs.uchicago.edu/). My interests lie in programming languages: compilation, verification, and using PL for better software engineering. I'm currently exploring applying these techniques to quantum computing.  Before starting my PhD, I obtained my undergraduate degree in computer science from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Subsequently, I worked as a software engineer at LogMeIn. Being an engineer at heart, I still possess a strong passion for utilizing technology to tackle complex challenges and for creating high-quality software.

Statement against open anti-semitism at UChicago
======
In light of the Oct 7 attack by Hamas against civilian Israelis and the following siege of Gaza, there are a lot of emotions on UChicago's campus. 
The unnecessary suffering on both sides is horrific and should be ended.
War crimes cannot be tolerated, especially the barbaric attacks on civilians ([which are too gruesome to recount here](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-attack-military-war-a8f63b07641212f0de61861844e5e71e)), but also water and [humanitarian aid](https://time.com/6324539/israel-gaza-humanitarian-aid-egypt-border/), such as the [aid provided by the EU](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/news-stories/news/eu-launches-humanitarian-air-bridge-operation-bring-aid-gaza-2023-10-16_en), shall not be withheld.
A peaceful solution is one we should all strive for.
I mourn with all those who have lost their lives or a family member or friend.
Many of my fellow students agree with this stance.
However, there a loud minority of people at UChicago that uses this opportunity to chant aanti-semitic statements such as ["from the river to the sea"](images/from-the-river-to-the-sea-sign-uchicago.jpg) ([learn more](https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/From-the-River-to-the-Sea)), saying Hamas' Oct 7 attacks, which [had the explicit goal of murdering civilians (and especially children)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/top-secret-hamas-documents-show-terrorists-intentionally-targeted-elem-rcna120310), are ["resistance groups that broke out of Gaza"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRXf4jvnqp/), claiming that the Israeli victims ["deserve it"](https://chicagomaroon.com/40110/news/sjp-begins-daily-quad-protest-advocating-palestinian-liberation/), calling to ["honor the martyrs"](https://twitter.com/zach_kessel/status/1713943867311988877/photo/1) (a statement clearly refering to the Hamas terrorists committing civilian massacres and war crimes on Oct 7).
The group on campus further restorted to ["Holocaust trivialization"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_trivialization) by [comparing the situation in Gaza to concentration camps](images/holocaust-trivilalization-uchicago.jpg), i.e., the Holocaust.
While the situation in Gaza is undoubtedly bad for civilians, it must not be compared to the worst crime in human history, where people of [specific ethnicities and beliefs were persecuted, interned, shipped like goods, to be brought to camps where they were intentionally stripped of all dignity, worked to death and to be executed in an industrialized meticulous system of evil](https://www.annefrank.org/en/topics/antisemitism/all-criticism-israel-antisemitic/).
Anti-semitism like this is beyond reprehensible.
I am appalled to hear such statements at my institution without an official statement of condemnation.
I am appalled that many of my colleagues sign on to [any open letters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aip8egzPT1SeY0mCjxUrkvEb8pZuTMhkWVffoB8Dlw0/edit) from an organization that promotes such speech and is in alignment with their goals (see next bullet).
I am appalled to have my union (UChicago GSU) endorse a core demand of this group: an academic boycott of Israel ([something reminding me of very dark times](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/)).
As a German, the phrase [**"never again"**](https://eg.usembassy.gov/never-forget-never-again-germany-and-the-united-states-mark-holocaust-remembrance-day/) carries a lot of weight to me.
Out of duty to my country's history and my Jewish community members, I felt it was important to **publicly distance myself from any such speech or from any affiliation with the groups involved**.

Thank you for reading. Please apologize the "off-topic" statement - I reserve such statements for extreme circumstances only.
